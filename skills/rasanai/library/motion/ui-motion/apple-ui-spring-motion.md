## What it is

Apple's interface motion is built on springs described with two designer-facing parameters rather than duration and easing curve. The WWDC18 session "Designing Fluid Interfaces" defines damping (the amount of overshoot, from 100 percent with none to 0 percent which oscillates forever) and response (how quickly the value tries to reach its target). It explicitly avoids "duration" for elastic behaviour because duration reinforces constant dynamic change, and it advises: start with 100 percent damping, "a spring doesn't need to overshoot"; use about 80 percent for gestures with momentum: "if the gesture that's driving the motion itself has momentum, then you should reward that momentum with a little bit of overshoot" (the Music app uses 100 percent for taps and 80 percent for swipe to dismiss). Interactions are redirectable and interruptible, with momentum projected to find the intended endpoint, and objects enter and exit along symmetric paths.

WWDC23 "Animate with springs" re-expresses the same model as duration plus bounce (range -1.0 to 1.0): smooth at 0, about 0.15 small, about 0.3 medium, avoid above 0.4, with presets `.snappy`, `.smooth`, `.bouncy`, and the conversion `stiffness = (2 pi / duration)^2`, `damping = 1 - 4 pi bounce / duration` for bounce at or above 0, mass 1. The HIG motion page lists the principles: purposeful, brief and precise, feedback, reduce motion.

## The defining traits (numbers)

- Default spring: damping 1.0, response 0.3 to 0.4 s (summary of Apple guidance in a search result; WWDC18 itself states the 100 percent rule without numbers).
- Momentum spring: damping about 0.8, response 0.3 to 0.4 s. Theoretical overshoot for damping ratio 0.8 is exp(-pi x 0.8 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)) = 1.5 percent (derived), which is why the effect is "a small bounce and squish".
- SwiftUI `.spring(response: 0.5, dampingFraction: 0.7, blendDuration: 0.25)` appears in the docs as a usage example; response typically 0.3 to 1.0 s.
- Momentum projection: the session code, as summarised by the fetch, is `projectedPosition = position + velocity^2 / (2 * decelerationRate)`, used to choose which corner a thrown element lands in. An earlier draft had `velocity / (1 - decelerationRate)`; re-check against the transcript before relying on either.
- Press feedback: scale to about 0.96 in 100 to 160 ms (derived; not stated in sources).
- Layering rule from the session list: one-to-one tracking during gestures, continuous feedback, spatial consistency (what enters from the right leaves to the right).
- Reduce Motion alternative: crossfade in place. For video, show the spring version.

Conversion for GSAP (derived): the undamped period equals response, so wn = 2 pi / response. For damping zeta below 1, wd = wn sqrt(1 - zeta^2) and x(t) = 1 - e^(-zeta wn t) (cos wd t + (zeta wn / wd) sin wd t). For zeta = 1, x(t) = 1 - (1 + wn t) e^(-wn t).

## How to build it

### 2D (HyperFrames, GSAP, 1920x1080, 30 or 60 fps)

```js
function spring(zeta, response, settle) {                   // returns an ease f(p), p in [0,1] over `settle` seconds
  const wn = 2*Math.PI/response, wd = wn*Math.sqrt(Math.max(1e-6, 1 - zeta*zeta));
  return p => { if (p >= 1) return 1; const t = p*settle;
    return zeta >= 1 ? 1 - (1 + wn*t)*Math.exp(-wn*t)
                     : 1 - Math.exp(-zeta*wn*t)*(Math.cos(wd*t) + (zeta*wn/wd)*Math.sin(wd*t)); };
}
function curveFromEase(f, n = 48) {                         // CustomEase wants a path; sample the function
  let d = "M0,0"; for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) d += " L" + (i/n).toFixed(4) + "," + f(i/n).toFixed(4); return d;
}
gsap.registerPlugin(CustomEase);
CustomEase.create("ios100", curveFromEase(spring(1.0, 0.35, 0.40)));
CustomEase.create("ios80",  curveFromEase(spring(0.8, 0.35, 0.50)));
const tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
window.__timelines["06-ui-spring"] = tl;
tl.to("#sheet", { yPercent: 0, duration: 0.45, ease: "ios100" }, 0.3)           // no momentum: damping 1.0
  .to("#card",  { scale: 1,   duration: 0.40, ease: "ios80"  }, 1.2)            // momentum: 80 percent
  .to("#card-body", { y: 0, duration: 0.40, ease: "ios100" }, 1.2 + 0.09);      // follower 90 ms behind
```

Steps:
1. Pick damping per interaction: tap or button reveal 1.0; flick, throw, swipe-to-dismiss 0.8.
2. Entrances travel from where the thing came from (a popover scales from the button: `transformOrigin` at the button centre), exits reverse the path.
3. Interruption (retargeting): at time `ti` the first spring is at `v = A + (B - A) * f((ti - t0)/dur)`. Start the second tween at `ti` with `from: v` to a new target; the velocity discontinuity is acceptable because the second spring starts at v with its own response; for a smoother hand-off, shorten the second response by 15 percent.
4. Animate only `transform` and `opacity`. Width, height and top cause layout and jitter in rendering.
5. Hold 400 to 1200 ms after the last settle before the next beat.

### 3D (Rasan3D)

```js
function spring(p, zeta, response) {                         // closed form, p = seconds since the move began; 0 before it starts, 1 after 0.5 s
  if (p <= 0) return 0; if (p >= 0.5) return 1;
  const wn = 2*Math.PI/response, wd = wn*Math.sqrt(Math.max(1e-6, 1 - zeta*zeta));
  return zeta >= 1 ? 1 - (1 + wn*p)*Math.exp(-wn*p) : 1 - Math.exp(-zeta*wn*p)*(Math.cos(wd*p) + (zeta*wn/wd)*Math.sin(wd*p)); }
camera: { pos:[[0,[0,0,3.2]],[2.4,[0.05,0.02,3.05],"power3.inOut"]], target:[[0,[0,0,0]]], lens:[[0,50]], fstop: 4.5 },
pose(t, k){
  const { shell, sidebar, content } = k.objects;
  const s = (t0, off) => spring(t - t0 - off, 0.8, 0.35);      // follower offsets 0, 0.09, 0.18 s
  shell.position.y = -0.5*(1 - s(0.4, 0));                     // enters
  sidebar.position.z = 0.05 + 0.15*s(1.2, 0.09);               // layers separate in depth, 2-4 frames apart
  content.position.z = 0.05 + 0.25*s(1.2, 0.18);
}
// panel faces from k.image("assets/screens/home.png") on k.panel(...), unlit; cursor stays DOM via k.pinDom/onDraw + k.toScreen.
```
`pose` is a pure function of `t` because the spring is evaluated in closed form, not integrated.

## What makes a cheap imitation

- `elastic.out(1, 0.3)` on everything: wobbly, toy-like, not Apple.
- A 300 ms `ease-in-out` bezier presented as iOS: no momentum, no redirection.
- Springs on exits.
- Layout properties animated (width, height, margin) so edges shimmer.
- All layers moving in lock-step: no secondary delay, so nothing feels physical.
- A phone mock-up bezel added by default.

Derived or unverified: ease approximations to GSAP names, press scale 0.96, all ms values other than the response range, the 1.5 percent overshoot (exp(-pi * 0.8 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)), my arithmetic) and the 0.93 x response settle time (solving (1 + x) e^-x = 0.02, my arithmetic). The SwiftUI `.spring(response:dampingFraction:)` page was not re-fetched this session.
