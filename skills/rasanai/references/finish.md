# Finish: film-wide motion blur and one grade

`scripts/finish.mjs` is the last step of a delivery render. It does two things to the whole film, whatever made each scene (DOM, GSAP, CSS, Lottie, Three, Rasan3D):

1. **Blur**: real motion blur on every scene. HyperFrames renders at fps x samples (the oversampled render), then ffmpeg averages each frame's sub-frames across a shutter window centred on the frame time. Today only Rasan3D scenes blur (inside the stage); this makes a 2D card whip, a type slide and a 3D orbit all share one 180 degree shutter.
2. **Grade**: per-frame film grain, halation, vignette, optional bloom and LUT, the same on every scene so cuts do not change the film's texture.

Drafts skip it. Use it for the delivery render, after the gates pass.

## Commands

```bash
# blur only
node scripts/finish.mjs blur  --project <dir> --out film.mp4 [--fps 30] [--shutter 0.5] [--samples 8|auto] [--quality draft|delivery]
# grade only (any mp4)
node scripts/finish.mjs grade --in in.mp4 --out film.mp4 [--grain 0.03] [--halation 0.2] [--vignette 0.2] [--bloom 0] [--lut look.cube] [--probe x,y,w,h]
# both in one ffmpeg pass (one encode, no intermediate generation loss): the delivery command
node scripts/finish.mjs all   --project <dir> --out film.mp4 --samples 8 --grain 0.03 --halation 0.2 --vignette 0.2
# brand-colour drift report for the current grade settings
node scripts/finish.mjs patch-test --grain 0.03 --halation 0.2 --vignette 0.2
```

Extras: `--composition <file>` (render a file other than index.html), `--workers n`, `--crf 18` (delivery x264 CRF; `--quality draft` uses CRF 20, veryfast), `--seed n` (grain seed), `--keep` (keep the temp oversampled render). Every command prints JSON: frame counts (expected vs got), seconds per stage, size in KB, the window used.

## Blur: how the window is aligned

Sub-frame k is a point sample at time k / (fps x N). Output frame n sits at t = n / fps = sub-frame n x N. The window is M sub-frame intervals wide, M = round(shutter x N) rounded to an even number (min 2), so it is centred exactly on a sub-frame: it averages sub-frames n x N - M/2 ... n x N + M/2, the two end taps at half weight (a true box filter of the sub-frame signal, symmetric about t). Shutter 0.5, N = 8 gives M = 4: five taps, weights 0.5 1 1 1 0.5. The first and last frames clone their edge sub-frame so every window is full. In ffmpeg: `tpad` (clone P = M/2 each side), `tmix` with those weights, `trim` M frames, `select` every Nth, re-timestamp at fps. Audio is copied untouched from the oversampled render; video is x264, BT.709 tagged.

Checked: sub-frame 8n of the oversampled render is pixel-identical to the normal render's frame n (so the grid is right), and the blurred card's centroid sits within 1 to 2 px of the sharp frame's centroid at the fastest frames (n = 38, 40: 1165.8 vs 1167.1, 1738.3 vs 1740.6). Frame count out equals frame count expected (90 of 90, 225 of 225); audio kept.

### Limits and trade-offs

- **HyperFrames renders at most 240 fps**, so one pass gives samples x fps <= 240 (8 at 30 fps). More samples come from phase-shifted passes (next section): `--samples 16|24|32` at 30 fps is 2, 3, 4 passes (at most 4: 32 at 30 fps). A count that is not a multiple of the per-pass count rounds up (12 becomes 16).
- **Steps, not a smooth streak, at whip speed with one pass.** The streak is made of N+1 discrete copies spaced speed / (fps x N) apart: 8 samples at 30 fps is 1/240 s, so 10 000 px/s leaves ~42 px gaps (visible 5-band staircase on a 300 px card, but centred and with no double image), 3 000 px/s leaves 12 px (reads as a streak), typical UI motion under 1 500 px/s is smooth. Shortening the shutter does not help (spacing does not change). Use `--samples 32` for a whip (below). Gap with 32 samples at 30 fps is 1/960 s, 10 px at 10 000 px/s.
- `shutter` is the fraction of a frame (0.5 = 180 degrees, the default; 0.35 for crisper, 0.75 for dreamier). The effective value (M/N) is reported.
- `--samples auto`: one extra draft render at the base fps, then the mean frame-to-frame luma difference (`signalstats` YDIF, cuts above 20 ignored) picks 4 / 6 / 8 by its 95th percentile (< 0.5, < 2, else 8). Measured: the whip test reads 8.7 (picks 8); hfdemo read 1.3 at its 95th percentile with the draft pre-pass and 7.7 at the maximum (a scene change); the p95 rule picks 6 for it (the run reported above used an older max-based rule and rendered 8). The render is a single fps for the whole film, so auto picks one count per film, not per shot, and a calm film renders fewer sub-frames (6 instead of 8 is a quarter less) at the price of the draft pre-pass (about one normal render). For a short film just pass `--samples 8`.

### More than 240 sub-frames per second: phase-shifted passes

HyperFrames has no time-offset or frame-range option (checked `render --help` and the sub-composition docs), and it snaps its own seek time to the render-fps grid. So pass k (k = 0 .. K-1) renders a temporary copy of the project (top-level entries symlinked, only `index.html` rewritten) with a small script at the top of `<head>` that wraps every GSAP timeline registered in `window.__timelines` (the host's, every sub-composition's, and Rasan3D's clock tween) so its `seek/time/totalTime` get `+ k / (R x K)` seconds, applied after HyperFrames' snap. R = fps x per-pass samples. The passes are then interleaved with ffmpeg `interleave` (pass k frame i is sub-frame i x K + k, time (i x K + k) / (R x K)) into one stream at R x K and averaged exactly as before. Verified: a +0.1 s shift makes frame n show frame n+3.

What is NOT shifted: CSS keyframe / WAAPI / Lottie / Anime animations, video and audio elements. Those still sample on the 240 fps grid in every pass, so a pass with only those moving gives duplicated sub-frames (no harm, no extra smoothness). GSAP-driven motion, the common case, and Rasan3D scenes are shifted.

Measured on the whip test (card at about 10 000 px/s, 1080p): 32 samples = 4 passes, window 16 sub-frames, 17 taps. The streak is a continuous ramp (R values 16 31 40 51 68 ... 254 ... 62 47 32, no plateaus), centroids 1165.8 / 1738.7 / 1883.1 at frames 38 / 40 / 42 against the sharp frames' 1167.1 / 1740.6 / 1884.0, 90 of 90 frames, audio kept. hfdemo (sub-compositions plus a 3D scene) at 16 samples renders 225 of 225 frames with no judder or doubling.

Cost: render time is K x the single-pass oversampled render, and tmix gets longer. Whip test: 4 passes 45 s + 20 s mix, against 9-11 s + 1.3 s for 8 samples. hfdemo at 16: 47 s render + 10 s mix (single pass 26.5 s + a few s). Multiplier against a normal render: about 3x per pass of 8 samples, so 16 is about 5 to 6x, 32 about 10 to 12x, before the grade. `--samples auto` now picks 4 / 6 / cap / 2 x cap / 4 x cap by the pre-pass p95 (< 0.5, < 2, < 4, < 8, else), but HyperFrames cannot render a frame range, so it is one count for the whole film: a film with one whip pays for 32 samples everywhere. For a mostly calm film with a few whips, prefer `--samples 8` for the film and render the whip scene alone at 32 if it matters.

## Grade: what each part is

Applied in this order (post.ts order, grain last so it sits on top), all in RGB at the source size:

| Part | Method | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LUT | `lut3d`, tetrahedral | optional `--lut look.cube`; place the film's look here |
| Halation | luma threshold at 80%, two blurs (5 and 22 px at 1080p), tinted (1, 0.18, 0.04), added | only highlights glow; `--halation 0.2`; midtones get exactly 0 |
| Bloom | same, threshold 65%, white, 14 and 48 px | `--bloom 0` default (off); 0.2 to 0.4 for a dreamy look |
| Vignette | multiply by post.ts's mask `smoothstep(0.95, 0.25, len)`, mixed by `--vignette` | the centre 25% of the radius is untouched |
| Grain | two scales (per-pixel 0.6 and 2x2 cells 0.4), one monochrome value on R, G, B, new every frame, seeded; amplitude x (0.55 + 1.2 l (1 - l)), so stronger in the midtones | `--grain 0.03`; post.ts's default is 0.055 (pdoom is a dark, gritty film); amplitude is calibrated to the ffmpeg build's measured noise |

Colour handling: BT.709 limited in, gbrp full-range work, BT.709 limited out. Vignette multiplies in encoded (gamma) values, not linear light as post.ts does, so the falloff is a little steeper at the same setting. Grain is clamped (no wrap), zero-mean.

### Brand colours do not move

`patch-test` renders flat patches, grades them, and measures the mean over a 60x60 area for 12 frames. With the defaults (grain 0.03, halation 0.2, vignette 0.2):

| patch | before | after | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| blue #3a6ea5 (centre) | 55, 109, 163 | 55, 109, 163 | 0, 0, 0 |
| red #c8392b (centre) | 198, 56, 41 | 198, 56, 41 | 0, 0, 0 |
| green #3f9a5a (centre) | 63, 153, 87 | 63, 153, 87 | 0, 0, 0 |
| blue near the corner | 55, 109, 163 | 51, 103, 155 | -4, -6, -8 (vignette, by design) |

Grain measured on flat grey (126): mean 125.99, std 1.50 levels at grain 0.03 (target 1.35 plus 8-bit rounding), frame to frame different. Anything inside the central ~25% radius keeps its colour; toward the corners the vignette darkens by up to `vignette x 0.59`. Keep key brand colours (logo, CTA) out of the extreme corners, or set `--vignette 0`. `grade --probe x,y,w,h` reports the same before/after delta for any rectangle of a real film.

## Cost (measured, 1080p, 30 fps, a busy shared machine)

| project | normal render | oversampled render (x8) | blur mix + encode | grade (grain+halation+vignette) | `all` total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 s test (2 DOM/GSAP tweens, audio) | 11 s (mostly start-up) | 9-11 s (static frames are de-duplicated) | 1.3 s | ~8 s (90 frames) | 22 s |
| hfdemo, 7.5 s, DOM + 3D scene | 10.7 s | 26.5 s (2.5x) | 27.8 s with grade | included | 64 s with `auto` (54 s with `--samples 8`) |

Rules of thumb: the oversampled render costs 2 to 3x a normal render (HyperFrames reuses unchanged frames, so calm films cost less than 8x), the grade is the heavy ffmpeg part (grain: about 10 frames per second at 1080p, i.e. a 3 minute film at 30 fps spends about 9 minutes in the grade; `--grain 0` takes it to seconds), size grows with grain (a 3 s clip: 0.2 MB without grain, 5 MB with grain 0.03 at CRF 18; grain 0.05 at CRF 18 is 12 MB). Total, plan for about 5 to 6x a normal render for a short film. Use `--quality draft` only to preview the finish.

## Rasan3D scenes and the finish

Rasan3D blurs inside its own stage: it renders up to 24 sub-frames per frame (adaptive to the on-screen travel of the scene) across `motionBlur.shutter` of `1/fps`, where fps is the stage option (30), not the render rate. At the 240 fps oversampled render the stage still blurs each sub-frame over a full 180 degree shutter. The finish then averages 5 of those sub-frames over another shutter, so the two convolve: effective blur is about twice as wide (shutter 0.5 + 0.5 is a 360 degree look) and the 3D render does 8x the sampling work for it.

Recommendation:

- Finishing with blur: set `motionBlur: false` in the 3D scenes (`Rasan3D.stage({ motionBlur: false })`). The film then has one shutter on every scene, 2D and 3D alike, and the 3D scenes render faster. Anti-aliasing and depth of field are separate (they stay on).
- Exception, a fast 3D move (on-screen travel above ~3 000 px/s, a whip orbit, a dolly through the text): the finish's 5 taps would step. Keep the stage's own blur but halve its shutter (`motionBlur: { shutter: 0.25 }`) and pass `--shutter 0.25`, or accept the double width as a stylistic choice. Both together are not broken, just wider and slower.
- Drafts (no finish): leave Rasan3D's default blur on.
- That the stage's blur is still active under oversampling follows from `samplesFor` and `fps` in `stage3d/rasan3d.js`; the combined look was not rendered separately.
